            <p>Thanks for checking out my website!  My name is Ariana Ortmann, and I&#39;m an Indiana naitive.  Currently I am a sophomore at Indiana University studying Informatics.  My degree concentration is in computer art, and I am constantly working on digital art projects in photoshop.  Using technology as a medium has been an increasingly intruiging concept to me over the last year.  Additionally, I have a great deal of fun with coding software.  I like to think of coding projects as big puzzles.  Analytical thinking has pushed me to really enjoy this kind of complex work, and my innate creativity has allowed me to expand discover a knack for combining logic with design.</p>

        <div class="six columns aboutmetwo">
            <p>My career goals are very vast but I know that I want to enter into the big tech industry.  Working for a company such as Google or Microsoft or Adobe is my ideal.  The idea is a company that is very tech&#45;heavy yet gleans recognition for their digital art.  With anticipated minors in computer science and website design &amp; development, I am able to cast a very wide net into this general field.  Ideally, my career will have me working on back end coding for small mechanisms or progrmas, and also creating dynamic visuals to match those projects.</p>
